        <p>introduce the game (nothing about the dress up yet)</p>
        <p>Nowhere is this magic better on display than in Yakuza 0’s Cabaret Club Czar. In it, you play as protagonist Goro Majima who decides to help manage a failing cabaret club on the brink of closure. The player must recruit hostesses from around town, then train them for the job by going on <span id="practiceDatesSpan">practice dates</span> and leveling up their stats through a fast-paced management simulator. Gameplay consists of matching hostesses from your roster to guests based on their unique strengths and what each guest is looking for. A customer is looking for a sexy girl who can party? You might put in Miss Isobe, the (recently dethroned) Disco Queen of Sotenbori. That mega-rich guy wants someone to talk to? Send him Etsuko, the loud old woman in the cheetah-print pullover whose base “talk” stat is completely maxed out, then watch as dollars bills literally erupt out of him and scatter across the club floor.</p>

        Cabaret Club Czar is a true fan favorite, consistently ranking at the top of “Best Yakuza Minigames” lists across the internet—for good reason. I lost countless hours to this relatively simple business simulator, which is I guess fun in the way that “number go up” games like this or Candy Crush or the stock market are fun for moms and finance bros respectively. All this to say, the minigame is a beloved piece of the franchise, and I’m far from the first person to comment on its splendor. Cabaret Club Czar changed my life—but, not for any of the reasons mentioned so far. It’s gameplay is deliciously satisfying. The story woven throughout it rules. The hostesses are all written to have so much personality, wit, and humanity, that by the end of it I felt like they were all <i>my</i> (Ella’s) best friends. No, what I want to talk about here is an overlooked and under-discussed piece of the Cabaret Club Czar minigame: its dress-up mechanics.

        Which is not as romantic as you might think—Majima never expresses any actual attraction toward them and pretty much all of them insist that they don’t see Majima as a “man”…okay??? 🤨🏳️‍🌈
