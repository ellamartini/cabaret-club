        <p>In a world plagued by boring video games, the existence of the <i>Like A Dragon</i> franchise feels like something of a miracle. While other studios trip over their own feet chasing things like photorealistic graphics and the next highest possible framerate, RGG pops open their twenty year old asset library, starts slapping blurry JPEGs onto buildings with an attitude that says "eh, it's good enough" and goes <i>What if we made an FMV version of <a href="https://youtu.be/h7ZOypRUpSo?si=2GvU4wUhcbtmueLR&t=5190" target="_blank" id="theBachelor">The Bachelor?</a></i> Then they spend six months working on that, release it to <span id="wildAcclaim">wild acclaim</span>, and move on to the next thing.</p>
        <p>There's something so uniquely charming to me about the studio's nonchalant attitude toward textures. They certainly <i>go off</i> on specific things (like the soft skin of their boys), but in general they're really taking a less-is-more approach here. By "less" I mean the literal quantity of pixels. And by "more", I mean more heart and soul and whimsy.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22525946/cloud-strife-square-enix-door-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade/" id="ffviiLink" target="_blank"><i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i> door texture</a> could never possess the blind, beautiful confidence that a low-res <i>Yakuza</i> asset just effortlessly has. The entire franchise is a blurry door texture.</p>

    <div class="textBox" style="margin-top:800px;">
        <p>You'll notice that the wall texture on display here is not a nice wood grain, and it's not the type of translucent shoji screen you might expect to see in a traditional Japanese restaurant like this. It's not even drywall. It's just a huge JPEG of some pots.</p>

    <div id="wildAcclaimTextBox">
        <p>I will admit that the FMV <i>Bachelor</i> is more of an aquired taste than something that the average <i>Yakuza</i> player would consider "good" or "fun". A taste that perhaps only the type of person who has been writing about <i>Yakuza</i> for two years could appreciate.</p>
        <p>And as long as we're being perfectly honest here, "wild acclaim" might also be overstating the general public's response to the Majima pirate spin-off game just a bit.</p>
