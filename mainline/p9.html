        My first video games were Y2K-era internet flash games. There were a lot of flash games in the era that definitely no child should have been playing, and a lot that probably no one should have been playing, or making for that matter. I should specify that my interests were specifically in the Barbie, MyScene, and Disney dot com variety. I spent hours on these sites playing flash games, most of which were arguably more like opportunities to click on a button and watch something happen. You click on Barbie’s lamp and it turns on. You mouse over her curtains and they ruffle. You click on a fingernail and it turns blue and sparkles. The modern games writer would defend these choices by saying that it was more about <span id="atmosphereSpan">“atmosphere”</span> and <span id="livingInTheGameSpan">“living in the game”</span> than the actual gameplay mechanics. It was more about living in Barbie’s world than winning at anything. It was magic to me.</p>

        This question has guided my research surrounding the cabaret club simulator. But, rather than trying to prove author intent on behalf of the developers, I’m more interested in how the feminine affects generated through the dress-up simulator resonate with self-described male players.

        This line was based on a RDR2 review I saw the other day. I guess if this type of gameplay is compelling enough for the average preschooler, it must be compelling enough for the average RDR2 fan as well.
